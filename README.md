# Last of Us: Legacy

**Project Overview**

Last of Us: Legacy is a 2D survival game inspired by the popular game "The Last of Us". Built using Java and JavaFX, the game is set on a 15x15 cell map where players control heroes and face off against zombies. The project showcases the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. JavaFX is used to build the graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances the user experience.

**Features**

- **2D Survival Gameplay**: The game includes a 15x15 cell map where heroes must survive against waves of zombies.
- **Hero and Zombie Characters**: Different types of heroes and zombies, each with unique abilities and stats.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Utilizes core OOP concepts including inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- **Graphical User Interface**: The game features a user-friendly GUI created using JavaFX, including interactive buttons and status indicators.
- **Grid-Based Movement**: Heroes and zombies move in a grid-based environment, with AI logic controlling zombie behavior.

**How to Play**

1. Launch the game by running the main Java class.
2. Use the arrow keys or mouse to control hero movement on the map.
3. Fight zombies and survive as long as possible.
4. Use in-game features to access hero abilities and view the game status.
5. The game ends when all heroes are defeated by zombies.

**Technical Details**

- **Platform**: Java (with JavaFX for GUI).
- **Programming Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
- **Map**: 15x15 grid-based map for gameplay.
